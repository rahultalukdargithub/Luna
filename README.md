# Luna
LUNA is an AI-driven IoT system that acts as a personal tutor, using NVIDIA-powered AI and the "llama3-8b-instruct" model. It communicates via WebSocket-based P2P connections, with plans to shift to MQTT protocol and integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain for enhanced responses.
